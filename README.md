Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Omer Keidar, M.Sc. in Data Science. Welcome to my Github page.
Here you will find several projects, most of which were conducted as part of the academic courses and duties of my Master's degree.
The projects contain documented implementation code (in Python) as well as summary reports.

### NLP
1. [Part-of-Speech tagger](https://github.com/Omerk9/Part-of-Speech-tagger) - implementation of a Hidden Markov model and an LSTM model.
2. [Authorship classification of twitter tweets](https://github.com/Omerk9/Authorship-classification-of-twitter-tweets) - manual feature extraction and word embeddings                                                                                                                           with deep learning models.
3. [Spell checker](https://github.com/Omerk9/Spell-Checker)
4. [Language modeling and generation](https://github.com/Omerk9/Language-Modeling-and-Generation) - n-gram language model

### ML
1. [Recommendation model for direct marketing](https://github.com/Omerk9/Recommendation-model-for-bank-direct-marketing) - Classification with fully-supervised learning  methods (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) and dealing with imbalanced data.
2. [Video games sales prediction](https://github.com/Omerk9/Video-games-prediction) - A binary classifier for the prediction of video game sales: from data understanding and visualization to modeling and evaluation
